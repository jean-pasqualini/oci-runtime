Great question. Short version:
•	platform/ = cross-cutting, reusable tech utilities (logging, config, metrics, tracing, error helpers). They don’t model your runtime’s business and don’t talk to the outside world on behalf of a use-case. Anyone can import them.
•	adapters/ = concrete implementations of your domain ports that do talk to the outside world (Linux syscalls, cgroups, namespaces, filesystem, OCI spec I/O). They exist to plug infra into your use-cases.

Think “Hexagonal/Clean”:
•	domain/: ports & core types (pure Go, no unix).
•	app/: use-cases/orchestration (pure Go; depends only on domain and platform).
•	adapters/: linux/ implementations of ports (uses x/sys/unix, cgroup libs, etc.). Adapters may use platform utilities (logger/xerr), but domain/app should not depend on adapters.
•	platform/: reusable helpers (logger, config, xerr, backoff, env detection). No business logic, no syscalls beyond what a generic lib would do.

What goes where for your init.go
•	MakeRootPrivate, Chroot, PivotRoot, Unshare, SetHostname → adapters/linux/ as implementations of interfaces defined in domain/ (e.g., MountManager, RootSwitcher, NamespaceManager).
•	Structured logging, error wrapping → platform/logging, platform/xerr (called from app/adapters).
•	The orchestration “init pipeline” (sequence of steps) → app/init/ (pure coordination over ports).

Quick checklist

Ask for each file/function:
1.	Is it a generic utility I’d reuse in any Go service? → platform/
2.	Is it the abstract interface my use-case needs? → domain/
3.	Is it the concrete, OS/driver/syscall/cgroup implementation of that interface? → adapters/
4.	Is it the business sequence (how to init a container)? → app/

Follow these dependency arrows only:

app  ──▶ domain
app  ──▶ platform
adapters ──▶ domain
adapters ──▶ platform
(domain/platform do NOT import adapters)

So yes: keep platform/ for reusable tech stuff; move your Linux/syscall code into adapters/, and keep app/ thin. This will make your init logic testable and portable without smearing unix calls everywhere.
